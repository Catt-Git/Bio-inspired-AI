# Benchmark: Genetic Algorithm vs. K-Means

This repository contains the benchmarking script and the visual results comparing our **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** against a standard **K-Means** implementation on four TCGA cancer datasets.

## Repository Content

### 1. Main Script
* **`comparison_with_kmeans.py`**
    * This is the core execution script.
    * **Functionality:** It loads the pre-processed datasets, executes both the Genetic Algorithm and K-Means clustering, and computes evaluation metrics (Silhouette Score, TWCV, Runtime).
    * **Output:** It automatically generates and saves the heatmap visualizations and the performance comparison plot described below.

### 2. Visualization Outputs (Generated)
The repository includes the visual outputs generated by the comparison script:

* **`performance_comparison.png`**
    * A consolidated bar chart comparing the two algorithms across three metrics:
        * **Silhouette Score:** Measures cluster cohesion.
        * **TWCV (Fitness):** Total Within-Cluster Variation (lower is better).
        * **Execution Time:** Log-scale comparison of runtime performance.

* **Cluster Heatmaps (`heatmap_*.png`)**
    These files visualize the confusion matrices for the specific datasets, comparing the predicted clusters against the biological ground truth (signatures):
    * `heatmap_BRCA.png`: Breast Invasive Carcinoma (PAM50 signatures).
    * `heatmap_CRC.png`: Colorectal Cancer (CMS signatures).
    * `heatmap_GBM.png`: Glioblastoma Multiforme (Verhaak signatures).
    * `heatmap_LUAD.png`: Lung Adenocarcinoma (Wilkerson signatures).
